  <p class="main">I am a self taught multi instrumentalist.
  I started with guitar as a teenager, then at the age of 21 I learned clarinet and soprano saxophone and finally at 25 learned to play the trumpet.
  <br>I perform regularly on all three instruments and have toured and gigged all over Europe and in the USA in many different formations for over 10 years. </p>

<h3 > Concept :  </h3>
  <p class="main"> I like to divide my lessons in different categories to better focus on all the aspects you need to grasp to be able to enjoy playing music.
  <br>I have had to find ways to improve fast and be able to perform in conditions where I had little time for preparation and still make it work. <br>Wether its improving finger speed or being able to play higher or sight read more efficiently, there is a way to redirect focus on important details and notice quick improvement. My task is to help you figure out why you are not satisfied with your playing and what you
  could do to change that. <br>Sometimes all it takes is one sentence to give you that eureka moment.  </p>
