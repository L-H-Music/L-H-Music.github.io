<p>I am a self taught multi instrumentalist.
I started with guitar as a teenager, then at the age of 21 I learned clarinet and soprano saxophone and finally at 25 learned to play the trumpet.
<br>I perform regularly on all three instruments and have toured and played all over Europe and in the USA in many different formations for over 10 years. </p>

<h3 > Concept :  </h3>

  <p> I like to divide my lessons in different categories to better focus on all the aspects you need to grasp to be able to enjoy playing music.
  <br>I have had to find ways to improve fast and be able to perform in conditions where I had little time for preparation and still make it work. <br>Wether its improving finger speed or being able to play higher or sight read more efficiently, there is a way to redirect focus on important details and notice quick improvement.
  <br> My task is to help you figure out why you are not satisfied with your playing and what you
  could do to change that. <br>Sometimes all it takes is one sentence to give you that eureka moment.  </p>
